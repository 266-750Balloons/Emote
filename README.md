Emote is a modern emoji picker for Linux ðŸš€. Written in GTK3, Emote is lightweight and stays out of your way.

Launch the emoji picker with the configurable keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+E` and select one or more emojis to have them be automatically pasted into your currently focused app.

Note - Emote under Wayland cannot automatically paste the emoji into other apps and also requires manual registering of a global keyboard shortcut - [Hotkey In Wayland](https://github.com/tom-james-watson/Emote/wiki/Hotkey-In-Wayland). This is due to intentional restrictions in the design of Wayland itself.

## Development

### Requirements

Install development libraries:

```bash
sudo apt install xdotool libgtk-3-dev libgirepository1.0-dev python3-venv gir1.2-keybinder-3.0 libkeybinder-dev flatpak-builder
# or with dnf
sudo dnf install xdotool gtk3-devel keybinder3-devel libgirepository1.0-dev
```

Install pipenv:

```bash
sudo pip3 install pipenv
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

### Running

Run the development version:

```bash
make dev
```

### Debugging GTK3 with GtkInspector

Enable debug keybinding:

```bash
gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.Debug enable-inspector-keybinding true
```

Launch app in debug mode with interactive inspector:

```bash
make dev-debug
```

### Packaging for Snap

Ensure you have `snapcraft` installed:

```bash
sudo snap install --classic snapcraft
```

Create a packaged `.snap` file:

```bash
make package
```

### Publishing

First, ensure a git tag for the current version has been pushed.

Ensure you are logged in to snapcraft:

```bash
snapcraft login
```

Push the packaged snap to the `edge` channel on the snap store.

```bash
snapcraft push --release=edge <path to .snap>
```

### Packaging for Flatpak

https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/first-build.html

Install `flatpak-builder` and the GNOME SDK:

```bash
make flatpak-install
```

Re-generate pip requirements if they have changed:

```bash
make flatpak-requirements
```

Build the flatpak and install it locally:

```bash
make flatpak
```

Try it:

```bash
flatpak run com.tomjwatson.Emote
```

Check installed files:

```bash
pipenv run flatpak-pip-generator --runtime='org.gnome.Sdk//43' --output python3-requirements "pygobject==3.42.2" "manimpango==0.3.0" "setproctitle==1.2.2"

cat ~/.local/share/flatpak/app/com.tomjwatson.Emote/
chmod +x ~/.local/share/flatpak/app/com.tomjwatson.Emote/x86_64/master/active/files/bin/emote

cat /var/lib/flatpak/app/it.mijorus.smile/x86_64/stable/
```

Put it in a repo:

```bash
flatpak-builder --repo=repo --force-clean build com.tomjwatson.Emote.yml
```
